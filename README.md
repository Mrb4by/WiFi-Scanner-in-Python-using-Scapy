# WiFi-Scanner-in-Python-using-Scapy
Have you ever wanted to build a tool to display nearby wireless networks along with their MAC address and some other useful information ? Well, in this project, we are going to build a Wi-Fi scanner using Scapy library in Python.

If you're on this field for a while, you might have seen airodump-ng utility that sniff, capture and decode 802.11 frames to display nearby wireless networks in a nice format, in this tutorial, we will do a similar one.
For this we need to install scapy and we need to use pandas to do a nice formating for us. After all those requirements we need to focus to write the code and we are then good to go for executing it.
